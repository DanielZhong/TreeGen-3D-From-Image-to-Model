# TreeGen-3D-From-Image-to-Model

## TODO:
1. Add BOOST lib to CMAKE if possible. Since didn't add it succesfully, I currently added through Visual Studio

(Project properties → C/C++ → General → Additional Include Directories, and add a path to the boost library root (in my case E:\Upenn\cis660\IPML2d\L-system inference\boost_1_84_0)

2. in ImportImageCmd.cpp(the main logic), try move helper variables(at the very top) into private member variables

3. Continue the remaining work

## Reference:
This project is inspired by the innovative approaches discussed in VCC's 2020 research on IPML. The study emphasizes the integration of IP (Intellectual Property) management with machine learning techniques to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of IP-related tasks.
